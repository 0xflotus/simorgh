# Simorgh Data Samples

These are a set of data samples which represent possbile input to Simorgh from upstream systems (and ultimately from a CMS).  They cover a number of scenarios, most of which are made up with random Lorem Ipsum or real text.

Two of the scenarios, 25 and 27, are based on real articles published on the BBC News website.

Some of the scenarios are intended to represent failures - where we would reject the articles as being malformed.

Scenario 23 represents an article which has been withdrawn.
