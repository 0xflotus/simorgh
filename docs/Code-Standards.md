# Simorgh Code standards

## Overview

We are following an AMP-first approach therefore all page components must be AMP compatible.
[Example of component with AMP Compatibility](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/psammead-image) â€“ the component is included in an AMP page and passes AMP validation

## Unit tests

## Linting standard

## Codified standards

### Automated processes

- Linting for code
- AMP validation for pages
- BBC a11y validation for pages
- Lighthouse validation
- Code Climate Quality tests
- These are guidelines and especially code duplications warnings should be considered on a case-by-case basis (in general Readability > DRY).

### Manual processes

- If latest has a broken build: stop what you are doing and fix it
- Code reviews take precedence over implementation
- Accessibility swarms
- UX reviews
