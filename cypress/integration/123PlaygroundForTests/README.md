# 123 Playground
This has not been committed by mistake. No tests should be in here in the latest branch if they are, remove them immediately. No exceptions.

## Why this exists
This is a testing playground which is named to also run locally when unignored. It is ignored by default by logic in the cypress.json at the root of this repo. To use it remove the ignore from that file, but it must be ignored in the latest branch.

This is named this way to always run first when cypress tests a run. It also directly mimicks the structure of our [pages tests](./pages) and must be kept up to date with them.

Engineers probably won't need this playground, but feel free to use it if you prefer to, it's an incubator. But tests must move from here before a PR is merged.
